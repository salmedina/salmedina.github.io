# INSTALLATION

### Dependencies

This site uses Jekyll and it's built-in SCSS compiler for the associated CSS, so the first thing you'll need is Jekyll itself:

```bash
$ gem install jekyll
```

In case you don't have the `bundler` gem installed already, you can install it as follows:

```bash
$ gem install bundler
```

For pagination, Gravity uses the [jekyll-paginate](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/) gem :

```bash
$ gem install jekyll-paginate
```

***

# USAGE

Once you have the required gems, you can go ahead and clone the
[Gravity repository](https://github.com/hemangsk/Gravity) or [download](https://github.com/hemangsk/Gravity/archive/master.zip)
a zip of the master branch.

Run :

```bash
$ bundler exec jekyll serve
```

Jekyll should now be generating your content!
