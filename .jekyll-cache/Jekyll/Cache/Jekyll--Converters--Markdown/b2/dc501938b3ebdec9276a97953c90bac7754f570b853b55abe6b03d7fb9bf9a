I"q<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_informatics" title="Materials Informatics.">Materials Informatics</a> is an emerging field that applies data science techniques to material science in order to better understand the discovery and development of advanced materials. This is accomplished by building process-structure-property relationships: data-driven models that can predict new material properties much faster than standard simulations.</p>

<p>This project for <strong>CSE 8803 Materials Informatics</strong> aims to build structure-property linkages for grain boundary pinning during grain growth.</p>
