I"v<p>I spent my <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/summer-internship-at-pnnl" title="Summer 2016 Internship.">summer working at Pacific Northwest National Lab</a>, but also made some time to get outside and explore more of the west coast. My trips included a few hikes, Los Angeles for my birthday, Portland, Seattle, the B Reactor, LIGO, and KDD 2016 in San Francisco.</p>
