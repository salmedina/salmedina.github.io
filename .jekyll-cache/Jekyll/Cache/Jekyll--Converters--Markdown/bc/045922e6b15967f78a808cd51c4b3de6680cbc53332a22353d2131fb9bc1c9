<p>The $35 credit-card sized computer ships with 512 MB of onboard ram, an ARM processor clocked at 700 Hz, and a full set of standard I/Os that are compatible with most peripheral accessories. Many lightweight <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads" title="Raspberry Pi Downloads.">Linux distributions</a> exist for the Raspberry Pi that can be sideloaded onto an SD card to act as the Raspberry Piâ€™s primary HDD.</p>

<p>I primarily use my RPi to use Python and tinker with small automation projects, so my RPi typically sits on my desk. I machined this solid aluminum case to protect the RPi from harmful outside interaction. The design maintains the Raspberry Piâ€™s functionality by leaving the sides open and LEDâ€™s visible while also allowing for others to view the microcomputer. The case looks great on a desk too.</p>
