I"Î<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_informatics" title="Materials Informatics.">Materials Informatics</a> is an emerging field that applies data science techniques to material science in order to better understand the discovery and development of advanced materials. This is accomplished by building process-structure-property relationships: data-driven models that can predict new material properties much faster than standard simulations.</p>

<p>This project for <strong>CSE 8803 Materials Informatics</strong> aims to build structure-property linkages for grain boundary pinning during grain growth.</p>

<p>Grain boundary pinning is a phenomenon in which insoluble particles are added to a microstructure. These particles affect the final grain size of a microstructure when subjected to a process (e.g. heating). In industry, it‚Äôs common to ‚Äúpin‚Äù a material in order to control its final grain size distribution.</p>

<p>Grain growth is possible to simulate, but often times the simulations are computationally expensive. My group is developing a data-driven, surrogate model to avoid these long simulations such that given a new set of input pin distribution parameters, we are able to predict the final microstructure after grain growth has occurred.</p>

<p>We do this by running initial simulations to train our model on, perform analyses such as spatial statistic computations and dimensionality reduction, and ultimately build a regression model.</p>

<p>Results so far looking promising, but we are still putting the final touches on the project report!</p>

<p>This project was started in <a href="http://materials-informatics-class-fall2015.github.io" title="Materials Informatics Class Fall 2015.">CSE 8803 / ME 8883 Materials Informatics</a> class taught in Fall 2015 at Georgia Tech and has since become a standalone research project. <a href="http://materials-informatics-class-fall2015.github.io/MIC-grain-growth/" title="Grain Growth Blog.">The project blog can be found here.</a></p>
