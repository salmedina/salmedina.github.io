  <time datetime="January 22, 2016" class="post-date">January 22, 2016</time>
  <p>How I started a daily journal to document every day of my graduate career and why I think journaling in general is a good idea.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="why-journal">Why Journal?</h2>

<p>If you were to ask me “why journal?” half a year ago I wouldn’t have had an answer. I never quite knew what a journal was for, and often times would confuse <em>journal</em> with <em>diary</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One thing I was never able to do, no matter how amazed by journals I was, was to actually start a journal myself. The reason being I mistook a journal for a simple diary where I would write down what I did that day. Just the sheer thought of taking time to write about the egg I ate for breakfast made no sense to me. I didn’t want to write trivial things, I just wanted to write the amazing things like Darwin, or Jefferson. I kept thinking that I was not good enough to start a journal.</p>

  <p>-Tulio Jarocki</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This excerpt well-characterized my view on journaling before I started. I didn’t think a journal could benefit me at all nor did I think I had enough interesting things to write about. But journaling isn’t about writing insightful think pieces every day<sup id="fnref:fn-thinkpiece" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn-thinkpiece" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. In the <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/category/uses/" title="Day One Uses.">same blog post</a> that the above excerpt is taken from, the writer provides a few answers to my earlier question about why someone should journal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Journaling allows you to understand yourself better</li>
  <li>Journaling allows other people to understand you better</li>
  <li>Journaling reminds you of the little details of your life</li>
  <li>Journaling makes you a better writer</li>
  <li>Journaling is the best motivation you will ever have</li>
</ul>

<p>After reading this I was convinced: I was going to start a daily journal so that I could capture every idea, struggle, and milestone of obtaining my Ph.D.</p>

<p>But I needed a good way to do this.</p>

<h2 id="the-app">The App</h2>

<p>I spent some time reviewing popular journaling apps and it quickly became clear that <a href="http://dayoneapp.com" title="Day One App.">Day One</a> was one of the best for iOS and Mac.</p>

<p>Each entry can include a picture, a log of one’s activity for the day, and tags for easy filtering. I have mine synced with Dropbox to backup my entries and have the ability to write from either my phone or computer. There’s a bunch of other useful features too, but instead of listing them here I’ll let you read them on <a href="http://dayoneapp.com" title="Day One App.">Day One’s website</a>.</p>

<div class="message">
<strong>Note:</strong> <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/2016/01/introducing-day-one-2/" alt="Day One 2.0.">Day One 2.0</a> launched in early 2016 and improves nearly every aspect of the app. Highlight features include multiple journals, multiple pictures per entry, bulk entry management, and a complete visual overhaul.
</div>

<h2 id="journaling-in-graduate-school">Journaling in Graduate School</h2>

<p>So I started journaling to capture my life and time spent in graduate school—so far I’ve had great success.</p>

<p>I record fun interactions with other people in my life, my ability to write has improved significantly, and I am able to make decisions easier by writing down my thoughts as they progress throughout a week, a month, or even a semester. In particular, I knew with graduate school would come a greater emphasis on writing than my previous technical focused undergraduate background, but keeping a daily journal has enabled me to parse scrambled thoughts faster and form them into coherent ideas and directions.</p>

<p>It’s also fun to look back at old entries to remember past events. For me, these include both stressful times, like how I wasted energy worrying about some future thing and its impact on my career, and more cheerful outings, such as particularly engaging happy hours with other first year Ph.D.’s.</p>

<h2 id="my-setup">My Setup</h2>

<p>Another great feature about Day One is the ability to write in Markdown. Since I use Markdown for all my notes and reports, it made sense to make a template for my journal entries to keep them standardized. Below is my daily format<sup id="fnref:fn-format" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn-format" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"># Day X  
## A byline describing the most important/interesting part of the day

This is where I write stuff about my day. If I had class or a 
lecture I'll include a one sentence summary which helps me 
emphasize the most important topics. Often times I write 
about my current research projects, but sometimes I'll 
include miscellaneous things like quotes and links to 
major news stories.

**Sometimes I'll bold a phrase that I want to stick out.**

I also write a quick summary of the days events, much 
like a traditional diary.</code></pre></figure>

<p>Tags are helpful to better filter entries when I want to look back. Some tags have a handful of entries and some have dozens. I’ve included a few of my more general and notable tags below to help someone get started<sup id="fnref:fn-tags" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn-tags" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>daily (to keep a quick filter for all the entries)</li>
  <li>gt (Georgia Tech)</li>
  <li>new person (to keep a record of any new person I meet)</li>
  <li>social</li>
  <li>quote</li>
  <li>music</li>
  <li>tech</li>
  <li>news</li>
  <li>website</li>
  <li>research</li>
  <li>data science (my first research area)</li>
  <li>visualization (my second research area)</li>
</ul>

<p>After writing and tagging an entry I attach one picture to the post and Day One automatically logs my location, activity, and weather from the day to give some context when reading.</p>

<h2 id="some-last-thoughts">Some Last Thoughts</h2>

<p>When I started this project I tweeted about it and Day One was kind enough to put the tweet on their <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/category/uses/" title="Day One Uses.">“Uses” website</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New project: writing daily <a href="https://twitter.com/dayoneapp">@dayoneapp</a> entries documenting graduate school life during the next four years in <a href="https://twitter.com/gtcomputing">@gtcomputing</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/GeorgiaTech">@GeorgiaTech</a></p>&mdash; Fred Hohman (@fredhohman) <a href="https://twitter.com/fredhohman/status/622506634649186305">July 18, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Looking back, my first entry (titled “Day 0: The Pre-Beginning”) was short and described the Sunday before I started research at Georgia Tech. The next dozen of entries were also short and walked a fine line between a journal and a diary. But as I slowly got into the habit of writing something down every day, the entries started to get longer. It wasn’t long until my average entry was 750+ words, with an all-time high of 1000+ words.</p>

<p>As a data enthusiast, the Day One iOS app contains a little bonus feature in the widget on the notification screen. Once enabled, the widget will show you a “words per day” chart. It was encouraging to see this bar chart grow taller and taller as time went on.</p>

<p>Hopefully now you can see the benefits of journaling, especially if you are a student.</p>

<p>I never thought I would write a journal, write about writing a journal<sup id="fnref:fn-meta" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn-meta" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, or even enjoy personal writing at all, but one semester down and I’m hooked. And even if you aren’t a student, I find that recording special moments, frustrating situations, and new ideas is a great way to brain dump at the end of a day.</p>
