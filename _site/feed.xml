&lt;p&gt;Our project built upon previous research conducted at Georgia Tech where researchers worked with medical professionals to determine if and what types of personal tracking health data could be useful for diagnosis and treatment&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn-previous&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn-previous&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgia Tech is involved in a project titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quantifiedcampus.gatech.edu/&quot; title=&quot;Campus Life&quot;&gt;Campus Life&lt;/a&gt; that seeks to study if students’ mental health is correlated with academic performance through the the lens of digital footprints, i.e. quantified self-like data. The program gave mobile devices to students to record several types of information regarding passive and active student health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our class project aims to study how people, particularly Georgia Tech students, could bring quantified self data into on-campus doctor appointments to have a more data-informed health discussion during a consultation. Moreover, what technology would be required to facilitate this discussion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our final design, titled the &lt;strong&gt;Health Easel&lt;/strong&gt;, is a new in-consultation health visualization prototype system that allows a patient to bring personal tracking data to their appointment and visualize relevant variables represented by simple charts on the display where both the patient and doctor can review in real-time to make informed health decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-scenario&quot;&gt;Current Scenario&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L:&lt;/strong&gt; Student arrives at STAMPS.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; Student swipes BuzzCard or types in Student ID at 1 of 4 lobby desktop computers each with a privacy desk. Student answers questions pertaining to primary care appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;l-middle&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;figure-grid&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;figure-grid-left&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/task/image02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;figure-grid-right&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/task/image00.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L:&lt;/strong&gt; Student walks back to primary care office and checks in with receptionist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; Student waits in primary care center lobby. Typically students spend waiting time browsing their mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;l-middle&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;figure-grid&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;figure-grid-left&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/task/image08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;figure-grid-right&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/task/image05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L:&lt;/strong&gt; Student is shown into a private room by nurse and asked to take a seat on the medical examination chair stationed near the center of the room.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; Nurse takes vitals and asks patients questions relevant to their health. Nurse turns away from patient to input this information into EHR system located on desktop. Student cannot see desktop unless 21” monitor is physically turned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;l-middle&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;figure-grid&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;figure-grid-left&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/task/image04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;figure-grid-right&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/task/image09.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L:&lt;/strong&gt; Nurse leaves and instructs patient that doctor will be in shortly (typically 5 - 20 min). During this time, patient either plays with mobile phone or walks around the room, viewing the space and examining brochures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; Doctor enters room and physically examines patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;l-middle&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;figure-grid&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;figure-grid-left&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/task/image01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L:&lt;/strong&gt; When finished with examination, doctor turns away from student and inputs information into desktop EHR system. If necessary, doctor can input any necessary prescriptions or follow-up recommendations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; The appointment concludes and student typically leaves with verbal information from doctor. Written information may come via EHR system or if doctor has provided an informational brochure from the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;l-middle&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;figure-grid&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;figure-grid-left&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/task/image11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;survey&quot;&gt;Survey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ran a survey to gather initial user data to provided insight into what features are important to the users for technology that could enable data-discussions. Three questions from the nineteen asked in the survey and selected responses are provided below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Prior to your most recent visit, did you do any independent research about your health concern or reason for visiting?	If so, what kind of research did you do? Please be as specific as you are comfortable being.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Googled the typical symptoms for the diagnosis I was given previously. I guess you could say I wanted a second opinion but I don’t want to go seek an additional doctor to give me. I was interested in seeing what the collective masses online had to say about my particular diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I looked into studies on mental wellbeing to see if there were things I could do in my daily life to improve my wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;looked up potential at-home treatments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Please share with us what made you feel uncomfortable/comfortable sharing or disclosing information with your physician. Please be as specific as you are comfortable being.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This was not their first rodeo, capable hands… And you know… Med school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;it was a doctor I had been to before, who I like, so I think that made me more comfortable sharing information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It can be really hard to disclose information to my doctor, even though I know they are trained professionals, I still fear I am being judged for what I have to say or how I feel. I am also very afraid of sounding stupid. Usually after talking for a little while, its easier for me to open up and talk without concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Using the following scale, what percentage of your questions or concerns do you feel were addressed during your last visit (e.g. 0% = None of my concerns, 50% = Half of my concerns, 100% = All of my concerns)? Why did you indicate this percentage in the previous question? For example, did you feel that your questions and concerns were answered fully or ignored? Please be as specific as you are comfortable being.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;81%. There is inherent guesswork in medicine, they didn’t really hit on all the symptoms I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;85%. I was given a diagnosis which appears to have explained a majority of the concerns I had. Everything else is just kind of personal problems I suppose. I am not entirely sure though. I think I would like to bring up more questions or thoughts, but sometimes it feels like there is no room in the discussion with my doctor to talk about these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;100%. They answered all questions I had, and I had no problems in the following weeks as I was treating my issue, indicating that any information they gave me was at least sufficient for what I needed to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-takeaways&quot;&gt;Some Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confidence/trust in doctor’s diagnosis and opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interest in personal data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lack of data-driven information during visits.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The barriers of convention and constraints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;affinity-diagramming&quot;&gt;Affinity Diagramming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we gathered initial user research data, we made a paper affinity diagram (left) to construct themes and related concepts from a bottom-up approach. We later focused our findings into high-level categories via a digital revised version (right).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;l-middle&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/affinity.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Our physical (left) and digital (right) affinity diagrams.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;diverging&quot;&gt;Diverging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team then set out to create many different ideas for a technology or device that could meet our discovered user needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;l-middle&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/20ideas.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A bunch of ideas for exploring what the future of personal data looks like in the doctor’s office!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;low-fidelity-prototypes&quot;&gt;Low Fidelity Prototypes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these ideas, we chose a subset of three ideas that we thought best captured user needs and could be further refined into a new capable technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;l-middle&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;figure-grid&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;grid-column: 1/3; margin-bottom: 0.5rem&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/3ideas-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;figure-grid-left&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/3ideas-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;figure-grid-right&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/3ideas-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design-sprint&quot;&gt;Design Sprint&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these three ideas, we storyboarded each for a poster presentation. The ideas ranged from a completely human-centered health identification system to a data-driven system that visualizes social context. Classmates anonymously voted for each idea using colored stickers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00B341&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Green&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is good. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #FFEC00&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yellow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is neutral. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #FF2925&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Red&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is bad. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0096FB&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blue&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/idea1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/idea1-dots.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/idea2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/idea2-dots.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/idea3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/idea3-dots.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our fellow classmates and professor gave insightful feedback, and it became clear which ideas were starting to stick. More importantly, our team recognized the importance of the time a student spends in a consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;l-middle&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;figure-grid&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;grid-column: 1/3; margin-bottom: 0.5rem&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/poster1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;figure-grid-left&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/poster3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;figure-grid-right&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/poster2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Hayley and Marissa presenting our storyboards.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;revisiting-ideation-one-more-time&quot;&gt;Revisiting Ideation One More Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our new feedback in mind, we looked at our initial matrix of ideas one more time to see if we could combine multiple ideas into our final prototype that could incorporate novel interactions which serve to better facilitate data sharing during primary care appointments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;l-middle&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;figure-grid&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;figure-grid-left&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/finalidea1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;figure-grid-right&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/finalidea2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The two selected ideas used to create the final prototype.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began to envision a device present in consultation rooms where a patient could display their personal tracking data and review it with their doctor. We identified two design characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The current appointment space layout is centered around the patient chair.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Depending the communication style of the doctor and his or her relationship with the patient (and particular needs of the appointment), they may prefer to demonstrate information or host an interactive conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;developing-a-physical-prototype&quot;&gt;Developing a Physical Prototype&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sketched out a device that features a large, high-resolution touch screen display mounted on a swiveling easel. This enables three different usage positions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standing position&lt;/strong&gt;: straight back, great for presentation and explanation from one user to the other.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inclined position&lt;/strong&gt;: at a height that allows users to sit in the examination chair and comfortably interact with the screen as the main user of the display.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tabletop position&lt;/strong&gt;: flattened to simulate a tabletop experience, optimal for visual analytics, collaboration, and discussion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/prototype.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/paper-proto.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introducing-the-health-easel&quot;&gt;Introducing the Health Easel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Titled the &lt;strong&gt;Health Easel&lt;/strong&gt;, our new in-consultation health visualization prototype system allows a patient to bring personal tracking data to their appointment and visualize relevant variables represented by simple charts on the display where both the patient and doctor can review in real-time to make informed health decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Health Easel prototype allows users, both patients and doctors, to conduct &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_of_Oz_experiment&quot; title=&quot;Wizard of Oz Experiments&quot;&gt;Wizard of Oz&lt;/a&gt; using magnets that hold paper visualizations from the front and back to accurately mimic window movement on a transparent touch display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;l-middle&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;figure-grid&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;figure-grid-left&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.5rem&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/inclined.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;figure-grid-right&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.5rem&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/inclined-use.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;figure-grid-left&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/table.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;figure-grid-right&quot; src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-6750-personal-informatics/table-use.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Health Easel being used in the standing position (left) and inclined position (right).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We conducted interviews with both students and medical professionals to gauge their interest in such a device and how it might be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student responses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Likes the idea of a system that can be used to explore data collaboratively with a doctor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thinks it should record the session, maybe records both interaction with the device as well as voices. Different color interactions to indicate who is moving or manipulating what information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thinks it is best used for appointments where patient is consulting with physician, instead of the patient being passive in the appointment. Specialized appointments for quantified self consulting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical professional responses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Liked the idea of having patients bring in real-life data for a shared conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Often explains charts but doesn’t make them. She would like to see the patient explain a chart, it might inform their decision making if they better understand their motivations and concerns.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Felt comfortable interpreting data charts “on the fly” as it is a normal part of their job. However, they typically have time to interpret the information before seeing the patient but wouldn’t mind working through it with an interested patient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wizard-of-oz-co-design-workshop&quot;&gt;Wizard of Oz Co-Design Workshop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a co-design workshop which focuses on doctor and patient Q&amp;amp;A session during a primary care appointment while incorporating Campus Life data using the Health Easel. In this scenario, we have participants role play with a member of the research team (roles include doctor and patient). In this scenario, we instruct the participant to imagine that a patient who regularly tracks their own data as part of the quantified self movement chooses to consult with their physician on specific data points during their yearly physical exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Wizard of Oz session we pose pre-identified questions to our participant in order to prompt the participant to create data visualizations in order to have a discussion about the student’s health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A post-experiment questionnaire was given. Selected responses are below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Do you feel that Health Easel changed the way you interact with students?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It could. I think it could. It would either reduce or increase the amount of patients we see. Some patients might try to use this system to tele-health, which could be both a good or bad thing. Alternatively, a system like this might be helpful if it were able to remote access so that a physician can offer assistance to patients in rural communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes. It felt like I was more in control and could participate in a conversation about my own health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Way more data in this. I love it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;poster-presentation-and-final-comments&quot;&gt;Poster Presentation and Final Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ar the end of the semester, our class held a public poster session where our team presented the Health Easel.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Unfortunately I was traveling during the poster presentation, so I wasn't able to present!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our group identified a few key areas to improve on for future work, including the ability to filter information quickly when visualizing data, an option to save the discussion for later use, and ensuring the prototype height could be adjustable to accommodate more people.&lt;/p&gt;

Our project built upon previous research conducted at Georgia Tech where researchers worked with medical professionals to determine if and what types of personal tracking health data could be useful for diagnosis and treatment1. Georgia Tech is involved in a project titled Campus Life that seeks to study if students’ mental health is correlated with academic performance through the the lens of digital footprints, i.e. quantified self-like data. The program gave mobile devices to students to record several types of information regarding passive and active student health. Our class project aims to study how people, particularly Georgia Tech students, could bring quantified self data into on-campus doctor appointments to have a more data-informed health discussion during a consultation. Moreover, what technology would be required to facilitate this discussion? Our final design, titled the Health Easel, is a new in-consultation health visualization prototype system that allows a patient to bring personal tracking data to their appointment and visualize relevant variables represented by simple charts on the display where both the patient and doctor can review in real-time to make informed health decisions. User Research Current Scenario L: Student arrives at STAMPS. R: Student swipes BuzzCard or types in Student ID at 1 of 4 lobby desktop computers each with a privacy desk. Student answers questions pertaining to primary care appointment. L: Student walks back to primary care office and checks in with receptionist. R: Student waits in primary care center lobby. Typically students spend waiting time browsing their mobile phones. L: Student is shown into a private room by nurse and asked to take a seat on the medical examination chair stationed near the center of the room. R: Nurse takes vitals and asks patients questions relevant to their health. Nurse turns away from patient to input this information into EHR system located on desktop. Student cannot see desktop unless 21” monitor is physically turned. L: Nurse leaves and instructs patient that doctor will be in shortly (typically 5 - 20 min). During this time, patient either plays with mobile phone or walks around the room, viewing the space and examining brochures. R: Doctor enters room and physically examines patient. L: When finished with examination, doctor turns away from student and inputs information into desktop EHR system. If necessary, doctor can input any necessary prescriptions or follow-up recommendations. R: The appointment concludes and student typically leaves with verbal information from doctor. Written information may come via EHR system or if doctor has provided an informational brochure from the room. Survey We ran a survey to gather initial user data to provided insight into what features are important to the users for technology that could enable data-discussions. Three questions from the nineteen asked in the survey and selected responses are provided below. Question: Prior to your most recent visit, did you do any independent research about your health concern or reason for visiting? If so, what kind of research did you do? Please be as specific as you are comfortable being. Googled the typical symptoms for the diagnosis I was given previously. I guess you could say I wanted a second opinion but I don’t want to go seek an additional doctor to give me. I was interested in seeing what the collective masses online had to say about my particular diagnosis. I looked into studies on mental wellbeing to see if there were things I could do in my daily life to improve my wellbeing. looked up potential at-home treatments Question: Please share with us what made you feel uncomfortable/comfortable sharing or disclosing information with your physician. Please be as specific as you are comfortable being. This was not their first rodeo, capable hands… And you know… Med school. it was a doctor I had been to before, who I like, so I think that made me more comfortable sharing information It can be really hard to disclose information to my doctor, even though I know they are trained professionals, I still fear I am being judged for what I have to say or how I feel. I am also very afraid of sounding stupid. Usually after talking for a little while, its easier for me to open up and talk without concern. Question: Using the following scale, what percentage of your questions or concerns do you feel were addressed during your last visit (e.g. 0% = None of my concerns, 50% = Half of my concerns, 100% = All of my concerns)? Why did you indicate this percentage in the previous question? For example, did you feel that your questions and concerns were answered fully or ignored? Please be as specific as you are comfortable being. 81%. There is inherent guesswork in medicine, they didn’t really hit on all the symptoms I had. 85%. I was given a diagnosis which appears to have explained a majority of the concerns I had. Everything else is just kind of personal problems I suppose. I am not entirely sure though. I think I would like to bring up more questions or thoughts, but sometimes it feels like there is no room in the discussion with my doctor to talk about these things. 100%. They answered all questions I had, and I had no problems in the following weeks as I was treating my issue, indicating that any information they gave me was at least sufficient for what I needed to know. Some Takeaways Confidence/trust in doctor’s diagnosis and opinion. Interest in personal data. Lack of data-driven information during visits. The barriers of convention and constraints. Affinity Diagramming After we gathered initial user research data, we made a paper affinity diagram (left) to construct themes and related concepts from a bottom-up approach. We later focused our findings into high-level categories via a digital revised version (right). Our physical (left) and digital (right) affinity diagrams. Diverging Our team then set out to create many different ideas for a technology or device that could meet our discovered user needs. A bunch of ideas for exploring what the future of personal data looks like in the doctor’s office! Low Fidelity Prototypes From these ideas, we chose a subset of three ideas that we thought best captured user needs and could be further refined into a new capable technology. Design Sprint With these three ideas, we storyboarded each for a poster presentation. The ideas ranged from a completely human-centered health identification system to a data-driven system that visualizes social context. Classmates anonymously voted for each idea using colored stickers. Green is good. Yellow is neutral. Red is bad. Blue is confusing. Our fellow classmates and professor gave insightful feedback, and it became clear which ideas were starting to stick. More importantly, our team recognized the importance of the time a student spends in a consultation. Hayley and Marissa presenting our storyboards. Revisiting Ideation One More Time With our new feedback in mind, we looked at our initial matrix of ideas one more time to see if we could combine multiple ideas into our final prototype that could incorporate novel interactions which serve to better facilitate data sharing during primary care appointments. The two selected ideas used to create the final prototype. We began to envision a device present in consultation rooms where a patient could display their personal tracking data and review it with their doctor. We identified two design characteristics: The current appointment space layout is centered around the patient chair. Depending the communication style of the doctor and his or her relationship with the patient (and particular needs of the appointment), they may prefer to demonstrate information or host an interactive conversation. Developing a Physical Prototype We sketched out a device that features a large, high-resolution touch screen display mounted on a swiveling easel. This enables three different usage positions: Standing position: straight back, great for presentation and explanation from one user to the other. Inclined position: at a height that allows users to sit in the examination chair and comfortably interact with the screen as the main user of the display. Tabletop position: flattened to simulate a tabletop experience, optimal for visual analytics, collaboration, and discussion. Introducing the Health Easel Titled the Health Easel, our new in-consultation health visualization prototype system allows a patient to bring personal tracking data to their appointment and visualize relevant variables represented by simple charts on the display where both the patient and doctor can review in real-time to make informed health decisions. The Health Easel prototype allows users, both patients and doctors, to conduct Wizard of Oz using magnets that hold paper visualizations from the front and back to accurately mimic window movement on a transparent touch display. The Health Easel being used in the standing position (left) and inclined position (right). We conducted interviews with both students and medical professionals to gauge their interest in such a device and how it might be used. Student responses: Likes the idea of a system that can be used to explore data collaboratively with a doctor. Thinks it should record the session, maybe records both interaction with the device as well as voices. Different color interactions to indicate who is moving or manipulating what information. Thinks it is best used for appointments where patient is consulting with physician, instead of the patient being passive in the appointment. Specialized appointments for quantified self consulting. Medical professional responses: Liked the idea of having patients bring in real-life data for a shared conversation. Often explains charts but doesn’t make them. She would like to see the patient explain a chart, it might inform their decision making if they better understand their motivations and concerns. Felt comfortable interpreting data charts “on the fly” as it is a normal part of their job. However, they typically have time to interpret the information before seeing the patient but wouldn’t mind working through it with an interested patient. Wizard of Oz Co-Design Workshop We developed a co-design workshop which focuses on doctor and patient Q&amp;amp;A session during a primary care appointment while incorporating Campus Life data using the Health Easel. In this scenario, we have participants role play with a member of the research team (roles include doctor and patient). In this scenario, we instruct the participant to imagine that a patient who regularly tracks their own data as part of the quantified self movement chooses to consult with their physician on specific data points during their yearly physical exam. During the Wizard of Oz session we pose pre-identified questions to our participant in order to prompt the participant to create data visualizations in order to have a discussion about the student’s health. A post-experiment questionnaire was given. Selected responses are below: Question: Do you feel that Health Easel changed the way you interact with students? It could. I think it could. It would either reduce or increase the amount of patients we see. Some patients might try to use this system to tele-health, which could be both a good or bad thing. Alternatively, a system like this might be helpful if it were able to remote access so that a physician can offer assistance to patients in rural communities. Yes. It felt like I was more in control and could participate in a conversation about my own health. Way more data in this. I love it! Poster Presentation and Final Comments Ar the end of the semester, our class held a public poster session where our team presented the Health Easel. Unfortunately I was traveling during the poster presentation, so I wasn't able to present! Our group identified a few key areas to improve on for future work, including the ability to filter information quickly when visualizing data, an option to save the discussion for later use, and ensuring the prototype height could be adjustable to accommodate more people.

A sliver of happiness during this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July&lt;/strong&gt;: During my internship I &lt;a href=&quot;http://fredhohman.com/blog/pacific-northwest-summer-photos&quot; title=&quot;Summer Trips.&quot;&gt;took a few trips&lt;/a&gt; to places like LA, Portland, and Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August&lt;/strong&gt;: As I left the Pacific Northwest to head back to Atlanta, I snapped my favorite picture of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December&lt;/strong&gt;: For my Information Visualization class, my group-mates and I made &lt;a href=&quot;http://fredhohman.com/projects/cs-7450-a-viz-of-ice-and-fire&quot; title=&quot;A Viz of Ice and Fire.&quot;&gt;A Viz of Ice and Fire&lt;/a&gt;, an interactive, narrative visualization summarizing the visual and textual aspects of the hit HBO series Game of Thrones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like last year, I’ll keep making the monthly playlists to find new music throughout the year. I’d also like to write some more technical blog posts too, most likely related to my graduate research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for now that’s all I have. Thanks for sticking around, and I’ll see you in 2017!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hit TV show Game of Thrones has won critical acclaim and the attention of millions of fans with its inspiring cinematography and brilliant dialogue. Dedicated fans of the show can recall critical scenes and key quotes with ease, but can they pick out high-level trends that emerge over the course of the series?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, in which season was the frozen North the focus of the plot? With all the violent twists in the plot, how often does the show’s dialogue tend toward the topic of death? This project for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~stasko/7450/&quot; title=&quot;Georgia Tech's Information Visualization Class&quot;&gt;CS 7450 Information Visualization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; seeks to highlight these large-scale patterns that might otherwise be missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can view the web visualization &lt;a href=&quot;http://fredhohman.com/a-viz-of-ice-and-fire/&quot; title=&quot;A Viz of Ice and Fire.&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-7450-a-viz-of-ice-and-fire/cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;A Viz of Ice and Fire.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visualization highlights the high-level aspects of each Game of Thrones episode, separating the data into &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;visual&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;textual&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; components. We process over 60 hours of video data and its subtitles (dialogue only) into nominal and quantitative variables of color and text frequencies as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/cs-7450-a-viz-of-ice-and-fire/cover2-cropped.png&quot; alt=&quot;The main interactive view of the visualzation.&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #ECECEC&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The main interactive component of the visualization.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure above shows the main interactive component of the visualization. It currently shows the top 10 colors for the entire series on top, the top ten colors for season 1 in the middle, and the top ten colors for episode 1 towards the bottom, as well as summary of the spoken dialogue and what words contribute to each textual category. However, a user can select any season or episode to update all color blocks as well as the text bubble plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the narrative visualization presents three case studies using the visualization pick out key scenes from the show’s history, as well as present some high-level series analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our code is easily scalable to include and remove different textual categories, as well as do extra text analysis on the data we have generated. The full code, including the web visualization, the python scripts used to process and generate the data, and the data itself, can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fredhohman/a-viz-of-ice-and-fire&quot; title=&quot;Github Repository.&quot;&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

My trips included a few hikes, Los Angeles for my birthday, Portland, Seattle, the B Reactor, LIGO, and KDD 2016 in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tri-cities-washington&quot;&gt;Tri-Cities, Washington&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tri-Cities area includes Richland, Kennewick, and Pasco, all of which border the Columbia River. A few nearby mountains overlook the area which make for excellent and windy hikes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have a car this summer but needed some way to get around. I found this bike at a local shop on my first day and road it every week this summer. I even shipped it back to Atlanta to use on campus!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;los-angeles-california&quot;&gt;Los Angeles, California&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my birthday I flew to LA to visit some family and take a short vacation. My favorite spots were Santa Monica beach and the Griffith Observatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;portland-oregon&quot;&gt;Portland, Oregon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent two weekends in Portland where I basically just walked around taking in the city’s peculiarities and eating more food than I should’ve. I recommend checking out the view from the top of Pittock Mansion.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Portland's vibrant colors.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seattle-washington&quot;&gt;Seattle, Washington&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t stay in Seattle long, but my time there was well spent enjoying the perfect weather (no rain!) and meeting more Georgia residents than I would’ve expected for being in the opposite corner of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;l-page&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;b-reactor-washington&quot;&gt;B Reactor, Washington&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_Reactor&quot; title=&quot;The B Reactor.&quot;&gt;The B Reactor&lt;/a&gt; “was the first large-scale nuclear reactor ever built.” I was able to take a tour of the facility with a handful of other PNNL interns to learn about an interesting and rather sensitive time in history. While the reactor is impressive in person, its location in the middle of the Washington desert is eerie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ligo-washington&quot;&gt;LIGO, Washington&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the B Reactor, the second massive scientific structure I toured this summer was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO&quot; title=&quot;Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory;.&quot;&gt;Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory&lt;/a&gt; (LIGO). Its purpose is to detect cosmic gravitational waves given off by the merging of two black holes billions of light years away. LIGO announced its first observation just earlier this year, so it was exciting to speak with the scientists and engineers after the first gravitational wave ever observed in human history was recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kdd-2016-in-san-francisco-california&quot;&gt;KDD 2016 in San Francisco, California&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended the summer by attending &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/&quot; title=&quot;Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.&quot;&gt;KDD 2016&lt;/a&gt; with my research group from Georgia Tech. My advisor organized a full day workshop on &lt;a href=&quot;http://poloclub.gatech.edu/idea2016/&quot; title=&quot;Interactive Data Exploration and Analytics&quot;&gt;Interactive Data Exploration and Analytics&lt;/a&gt; that had some great speakers.

&lt;p&gt;And with that it’s time to say goodbye to Summer 2016. The west coast weather has been a nice change of pace from the all too humid Atlanta summers. And in-between all that traveling I happened to get some research done too. 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-survived&quot;&gt;I Survived&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computational Science &amp;amp; Engineering (CSE) at Georgia Tech, the smallest school in the College of Computing, has a great environment for its Ph.D. students and offers courses that are exploding with popularity all throughout Georgia Tech. But a Ph.D. isn’t about taking more classes. A Ph.D. is an apprenticeship with a focus on producing new (and hopefully exciting!) research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;PhD Year I: done.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Fred Hohman (@fredhohman) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fredhohman/status/728667114047995904&quot;&gt;May 6, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my first year, I’ve been working in the field of materials informatics: a new field that uses the power of data science techniques to better solve problems in materials science. A year ago this seemed like a good fit considering my background in math, physics, and interest in data. Over the past two semesters I contributed to a handful of related projects, including bypassing expensive simulations by building a &lt;a href=&quot;http://fredhohman.com/projects/material-informatics-grain-growth&quot; title=&quot;Materials Informatics Grain Growth Project.&quot;&gt;surrogate model for material grain growth&lt;/a&gt;, contributing to the open-source materials informatics python package &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pymks.org&quot; title=&quot;PyMKS.&quot;&gt;PyMKS&lt;/a&gt; developed within the research group, and applying informatics approaches to advanced materials in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darpa.mil/program/materials-development-for-platforms&quot; title=&quot;Materials Development for Platforms.&quot;&gt;Materials Development Program&lt;/a&gt; funded by DARPA. Throughout these projects I’ve worked hard and met wonderful and intelligent people, but as time went on my interest began to fade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after much thinking and discussion&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn-discussion&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn-discussion&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I have decided to stop my materials informatics work and switch to something that better fits my interests while I am still early in my graduate career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-polo-club-of-data-science&quot;&gt;The Polo Club of Data Science&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m fortunate that CSE here at Georgia Tech conducts research in many fields. So after, yes, &lt;em&gt;more thinking and discussion&lt;/em&gt;, I am excited to say that I am joining the &lt;a href=&quot;http://poloclub.gatech.edu&quot; title=&quot;Polo Club of Data Science.&quot;&gt;Polo Club of Data Science&lt;/a&gt; led by Dr. Polo Chau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polo Club’s primary research bridges &lt;strong&gt;data mining and machine learning&lt;/strong&gt; techniques with principles from &lt;strong&gt;human-computer interaction and visualization&lt;/strong&gt; to make interactive tools to help people understand and explore big data&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:research-areas&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:research-areas&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unique combination enables one to stay current with the latest analytic and machine learning practices as well as refine one’s visual design work and communication through interactive visualizations. Polo was recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cse.gatech.edu/news/522401/12m-nsf-award-helps-consumers-enter-age-big-data&quot; title=&quot;$1.2M NSF Award Helps Consumers Enter Age of Big Data.&quot;&gt;awarded a new NSF grant&lt;/a&gt; that proposes similar ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It is about how to make sense of a large amount of different kinds of data using ‘natural’ ways to interact and explore their representations.”
With this award, Abello and Chau will take on the challenge of computer-human interactive exploration of information-rich, billion-scale network data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research echoes my older “math + design” idea in the context of computing, and I think there’s much to be explored. So starting next semester I’ll be advised by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dchau/&quot; title=&quot;Polo Chau.&quot;&gt;Dr. Polo Chau&lt;/a&gt; of CSE and co-advised by &lt;a href=&quot;http://va.gatech.edu/endert/&quot; title=&quot;Alex Endert.&quot;&gt;Dr. Alex Endert&lt;/a&gt; of the School of Interactive Computing (IC). This allows me to keep one foot in CSE for analytics and one foot in IC for visualization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-was-warned-about-this&quot;&gt;I Was Warned About This&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my senior year at my undergraduate institution, I recall a conversation I had with a math faculty member and a graduating Ph.D. student regarding my future as a graduate student. They both said “However hard you think graduate school is, it’s harder.” That’s probably true, but a supportive community and exciting work help ease the difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

Georgia Tech, a team with much history, is no different. Saturdays in Atlanta during the college football season are packed with fans: students, alumni, and miscellaneous visitors. Regardless if Georgia Tech wins or loses, a sold-out &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Dodd_Stadium&quot; title=&quot;Bobby-Dodd stadium.&quot;&gt;Bobby-Dodd&lt;/a&gt; stadium creates a large amount of hustle and bustle on nearby sidewalks and streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project for &lt;strong&gt;CSE 6730 Modeling &amp;amp; Simulation&lt;/strong&gt; aims to create a model to simulate the foot traffic after the conclusion of a Georgia Tech football game. My group had just a few weeks to define the conceptual model, make realistic assumptions, collect physical data about typical evacuation trends and distributions, implement the model, and present our results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the cartography of Google Maps, we use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton&quot; title=&quot;Cellular automaton.&quot;&gt;cellular automaton&lt;/a&gt; simulation driven by various force fields such as static attractor fields and dynamic fields. We model typical crowd behavior using cellular automaton rules that our simulated fans follow. We identify the ten exits of Bobby-Dodd stadium as the spawning points where people are introduced into the simulation. We then pick five targeted exits on the map around Bobby-Dodd stadium that our fans will walk towards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;l-middle&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Our chosen simulation path network.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We verify and validate our model via visualization. Knowing that Bobby-Dodd stadium can seat 55,000 people, we can visualize our model by overlaying the map with the simulated people color-coordinated by exit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-journal&quot;&gt;Why Journal?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were to ask me “why journal?” half a year ago I wouldn’t have had an answer. I never quite knew what a journal was for, and often times would confuse &lt;em&gt;journal&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;diary&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One thing I was never able to do, no matter how amazed by journals I was, was to actually start a journal myself. The reason being I mistook a journal for a simple diary where I would write down what I did that day. Just the sheer thought of taking time to write about the egg I ate for breakfast made no sense to me. I didn’t want to write trivial things, I just wanted to write the amazing things like Darwin, or Jefferson. I kept thinking that I was not good enough to start a journal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;-Tulio Jarocki&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This excerpt well-characterized my view on journaling before I started. I didn’t think a journal could benefit me at all nor did I think I had enough interesting things to write about. But journaling isn’t about writing insightful think pieces every day&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn-thinkpiece&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn-thinkpiece&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dayoneapp.com/category/uses/&quot; title=&quot;Day One Uses.&quot;&gt;same blog post&lt;/a&gt; that the above excerpt is taken from, the writer provides a few answers to my earlier question about why someone should journal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Journaling allows you to understand yourself better&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Journaling allows other people to understand you better&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Journaling reminds you of the little details of your life&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Journaling makes you a better writer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Journaling is the best motivation you will ever have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading this I was convinced: I was going to start a daily journal so that I could capture every idea, struggle, and milestone of obtaining my Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I needed a good way to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-app&quot;&gt;The App&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent some time reviewing popular journaling apps and it quickly became clear that &lt;a href=&quot;http://dayoneapp.com&quot; title=&quot;Day One App.&quot;&gt;Day One&lt;/a&gt; was one of the best for iOS and Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each entry can include a picture, a log of one’s activity for the day, and tags for easy filtering. I have mine synced with Dropbox to backup my entries and have the ability to write from either my phone or computer. There’s a bunch of other useful features too, but instead of listing them here I’ll let you read them on &lt;a href=&quot;http://dayoneapp.com&quot; title=&quot;Day One App.&quot;&gt;Day One’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://dayoneapp.com/2016/01/introducing-day-one-2/&quot; alt=&quot;Day One 2.0.&quot;&gt;Day One 2.0&lt;/a&gt; launched in early 2016 and improves nearly every aspect of the app. Highlight features include multiple journals, multiple pictures per entry, bulk entry management, and a complete visual overhaul.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;journaling-in-graduate-school&quot;&gt;Journaling in Graduate School&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started journaling to capture my life and time spent in graduate school—so far I’ve had great success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I record fun interactions with other people in my life, my ability to write has improved significantly, and I am able to make decisions easier by writing down my thoughts as they progress throughout a week, a month, or even a semester. In particular, I knew with graduate school would come a greater emphasis on writing than my previous technical focused undergraduate background, but keeping a daily journal has enabled me to parse scrambled thoughts faster and form them into coherent ideas and directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also fun to look back at old entries to remember past events. For me, these include both stressful times, like how I wasted energy worrying about some future thing and its impact on my career, and more cheerful outings, such as particularly engaging happy hours with other first year Ph.D.’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-setup&quot;&gt;My Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great feature about Day One is the ability to write in Markdown. Since I use Markdown for all my notes and reports, it made sense to make a template for my journal entries to keep them standardized. Below is my daily format&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn-format&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn-format&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;# Day X  
## A byline describing the most important/interesting part of the day

This is where I write stuff about my day. If I had class or a 
lecture I'll include a one sentence summary which helps me 
emphasize the most important topics. Often times I write 
about my current research projects, but sometimes I'll 
include miscellaneous things like quotes and links to 
major news stories.

**Sometimes I'll bold a phrase that I want to stick out.**

I also write a quick summary of the days events, much 
like a traditional diary.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tags are helpful to better filter entries when I want to look back. Some tags have a handful of entries and some have dozens. I’ve included a few of my more general and notable tags below to help someone get started&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn-tags&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn-tags&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;daily (to keep a quick filter for all the entries)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gt (Georgia Tech)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;new person (to keep a record of any new person I meet)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;social&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;quote&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;music&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tech&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;news&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;website&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;data science (my first research area)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;visualization (my second research area)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After writing and tagging an entry I attach one picture to the post and Day One automatically logs my location, activity, and weather from the day to give some context when reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-last-thoughts&quot;&gt;Some Last Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started this project I tweeted about it and Day One was kind enough to put the tweet on their &lt;a href=&quot;http://dayoneapp.com/category/uses/&quot; title=&quot;Day One Uses.&quot;&gt;“Uses” website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;New project: writing daily &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dayoneapp&quot;&gt;@dayoneapp&lt;/a&gt; entries documenting graduate school life during the next four years in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gtcomputing&quot;&gt;@gtcomputing&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GeorgiaTech&quot;&gt;@GeorgiaTech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Fred Hohman (@fredhohman) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fredhohman/status/622506634649186305&quot;&gt;July 18, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, my first entry (titled “Day 0: The Pre-Beginning”) was short and described the Sunday before I started research at Georgia Tech. The next dozen of entries were also short and walked a fine line between a journal and a diary. But as I slowly got into the habit of writing something down every day, the entries started to get longer. It wasn’t long until my average entry was 750+ words, with an all-time high of 1000+ words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a data enthusiast, the Day One iOS app contains a little bonus feature in the widget on the notification screen. Once enabled, the widget will show you a “words per day” chart. It was encouraging to see this bar chart grow taller and taller as time went on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully now you can see the benefits of journaling, especially if you are a student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never thought I would write a journal, write about writing a journal&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn-meta&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn-meta&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, or even enjoy personal writing at all, but one semester down and I’m hooked. And even if you aren’t a student, I find that recording special moments, frustrating situations, and new ideas is a great way to brain dump at the end of a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:fn-thinkpiece&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Unless you really do have that many interesting things to say! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:fn-thinkpiece&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:fn-format&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Although I may tweak this in the future. Always open to suggestions! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:fn-format&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:fn-tags&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This list is only a third of the total amount of tags I use. Others include specific locations that I occasionally visit and my graduate classes. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:fn-tags&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:fn-meta&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;How meta. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:fn-meta&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

This is accomplished by building process-structure-property relationships: data-driven models that can predict new material properties much faster than standard simulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project for &lt;strong&gt;CSE 8803 Materials Informatics&lt;/strong&gt; aims to build structure-property linkages for grain boundary pinning during grain growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grain boundary pinning is a phenomenon in which insoluble particles are added to a microstructure. These particles affect the final grain size of a microstructure when subjected to a process (e.g. heating). In industry, it’s common to “pin” a material in order to control its final grain size distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grain growth is possible to simulate, but often times the simulations are computationally expensive. My group is developing a data-driven, surrogate model to avoid these long simulations such that given a new set of input pin distribution parameters, we are able to predict the final microstructure after grain growth has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do this by running initial simulations to train our model on, perform analyses such as spatial statistic computations and dimensionality reduction, and ultimately build a regression model.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Low dimensional representation of the inputs and outputs of our model.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results so far looking promising, but we are still putting the final touches on the project report!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was started in &lt;a href=&quot;http://materials-informatics-class-fall2015.github.io&quot; title=&quot;Materials Informatics Class Fall 2015.&quot;&gt;CSE 8803 / ME 8883 Materials Informatics&lt;/a&gt; class taught in Fall 2015 at Georgia Tech and has since become a standalone research project. &lt;a href=&quot;http://materials-informatics-class-fall2015.github.io/MIC-grain-growth/&quot; title=&quot;Grain Growth Blog.&quot;&gt;The project blog can be found here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
